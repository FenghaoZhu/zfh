This speech, presented at the IMT-2030 (6G) RIS technology task group, introduces the innovative Meta-learning based Gradient Enhanced Beamforming (MGEB) method, designed for robust beamforming in various scenarios. The key innovation of MGEB lies in its approach of using gradients as input instead of traditional channel matrices, which allows for a simpler, pretraining-free deployment and relies on smaller scale neural networks, enhancing robustness and reducing computational costs. By leveraging meta-learning strategies, MGEB achieves high sum rates across different settings, showcasing its superiority over traditional methods in terms of efficiency and adaptability to dynamic and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios. This research not only presents a significant advancement in RIS-aided beamforming optimization but also proposes a viable solution for real-world deployment in the emerging 6G communications landscape.
