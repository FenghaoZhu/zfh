I'm a undergraduate student from [School of ISEE](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes AI for wireless communications, robust models, deep learning for science, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chongwen Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huang-Chongwen/stats) of institude of information, communication and network engineering, Zhejiang University.

Previously, I have research experience as an research intern in Zhejiang university. My research focus is optimization algorithm of beamforming in RIS-aided wireless communications.

Specifically, I proposed a gradient-based method that feeds the gradient of spectral efficiency (the optimization object function) into customized NNs, and uses a meta learning technique to collaborate the optimization of the precoding matrix and shift matrix. This research project has been accepted and orally presented at IEEE ICC 2024 (IEEE ComSoc Student Grant awarded). Moreover, an upgraded version of this work is presently under minor revisions for IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. I also produced 3 patents, which are currently under review by the State Intellectual Property Office.

Currently, I am using ODE-based NNs to further improve the previous work's robustness and reduce its computational complexity. The proposed algorithm with gradient-as-input mechanism and ODE-based NN structure improved the performance by 2% while requiring only 1.61% of time consumption. 

Several publications and patents in deep learning optimization have been published during my internship as an intern. Please refer [my publications](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/publications/) for papers and [my patents](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/patents/) for patents.

During my internship, I developed useful skills in Python and PyTorch programming, as well as in academic presentation and writing.
