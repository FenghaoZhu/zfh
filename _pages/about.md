I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of ISEE](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes wireless communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, optimization and deep learning.

As a undergraduate RA, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chongwen Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huang-Chongwen/stats) of institude of information, communication and network engineering, Zhejiang University.

Several publications and patents in deep learning optimization have been published during my internship as a RA in Zhejiang university. Please refer [my publications](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/publications/) for papers and [my portfolio](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/publications/) for patents.
