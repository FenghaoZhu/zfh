I'm a graduate student from [School of ISEE](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes NeuroAI, robust optimization, AI for science, wireless communications etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chongwen Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huang-Chongwen/stats) of institude of information, communication and network engineering, Zhejiang University.

My research focus is optimization algorithm of beamforming in RIS-aided wireless communications. Specifically, I proposed a gradient-based method that feeds the gradient of spectral efficiency (the optimization object function) into customized NNs, and uses a meta learning technique to collaborate the optimization of the precoding matrix and shift matrix. This research project has been accepted for and will be orally presented at IEEE ICC 2024. Moreover, an upgraded version of this work is presently under major revisions for IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. I also produced two patents, which are currently under review by the State Intellectual Property Office.
Currently, my research interest is to use ODE-based NNs to further improve the previous work's robustness and reduce its computational complexity.

Several publications and patents in deep learning optimization have been published during my internship as an intern. Please refer [my publications](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/publications/) for papers and [my patents](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/patents/) for patents.

During my internship, I developed useful skills in Python and PyTorch programming, as well as in academic presentation and writing.
